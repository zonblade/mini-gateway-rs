//! # Statistics API Module
//! 
//! This module provides endpoints for collecting, analyzing, and reporting statistics
//! related to the gateway and proxy services. It enables monitoring of system performance,
//! usage patterns, and health metrics.
//! 
//! ## Features
//! 
//! The Statistics API is designed to provide:
//! 
//! - **Real-time Metrics**: Current performance data of gateway and proxy nodes
//! - **Historical Data**: Aggregated statistics over various time periods
//! - **System Health**: Information about the overall system status and health
//! - **Traffic Analysis**: Patterns and trends in request/response flows
//! - **Error Reporting**: Aggregated error statistics and frequencies
//! 
//! ## Endpoints (Planned)
//! 
//! - `GET /api/v1/statistics/overview` - Summary of key performance indicators
//! - `GET /api/v1/statistics/gateways/{id}` - Statistics for a specific gateway node
//! - `GET /api/v1/statistics/proxies/{id}` - Statistics for a specific proxy node
//! - `GET /api/v1/statistics/traffic` - Traffic patterns and volume data
//! - `GET /api/v1/statistics/errors` - Error frequency and distribution
//! 
//! ## Authorization
//! 
//! Statistics endpoints require authentication and are typically restricted to users
//! with admin or staff roles, as they provide sensitive operational data about the system.
//! 
//! ## Data Collection
//! 
//! Statistics are collected through background processes that:
//! 
//! 1. Gather metrics from running gateway and proxy nodes
//! 2. Store this data in a time-series format
//! 3. Aggregate and analyze the data for reporting
//! 4. Provide both real-time and historical views
